Itis now my pleasing duty gratel'ully to acknowledge the handsome
manner in which Baron von Mueller has fullilled his promise of ufford-
ing mc every assistance in the prosecution of the ardnous tsslr Ι had
undertaken. Hc hus regularly transmitted to me, arranged for each
volume, the vast stores of Australian specimens collected by his own
exertions, as well aa by the able collectore hohas employed and the
numerous residents and other correspondents whom he had inspired
with alove for the sciencc. l have been able also to take full ad·
vantage of the results of his own previous study of the specimens‚ as
published in his Fragmenta, the sheets ol which hohas regularly ior·
wardcd to me as printed off. The specimus, after having been worked
np, have been successively returned, and the numerous consignmcnts
have reached Melbourne without a single loss, the last of the Gramineae
and the ferna alone being still on their way home.

To the various other sources enumerated in the Presace to the first
volume, as having supplied me with materiale ior this work, the most
important additions 1 have ιο record arc the valuable collectione made
by M. Schultz, at Port Darwin, and by some of the recent explorers
of Ocntral Australia, of which Dr. Schomburglr, the active Diroctor
of the Botanical Gardcns of Adelaide, has transmitted to me almost
complete sets, anda number of interesting specimens, chiefly from
the northern districts oi Ncw South Wales and from Irord Howc’s
island, sent ιο me by Dr. Maure, Director ol the Sydney Botanic ¹
(iarden.
