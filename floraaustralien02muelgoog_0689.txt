Lycopcdium pumilio, R. Br. Prod. 166 (Selayinslta pumilio, Spring‚ Monogr. Lycop.
ii. 241), is founded upon 2 minute s imens which had been mixed with some other
dwarf planta in Banke and Solen er's Endeevour River collection, they araboth
quite simplo with asingle flhre to the root, cuelin. high, the other very little longer
though in fruit. They appear to be small atarved specimens bulting the tlrat year,
perhaps ol S. Belanyers', although the bracia ere much smaller than in that speciae
more like those 01 the Ceylonese L. ciliove, Rata, but some of Schultn's epecimens 01
