Spilselets l-flowered, sessile or very shortly pedicellate in a simple
spihe or in a scarcely branched spihelike penicle, the rhachis of the

‚ spihelet articulate above the 2 outcr glumcs. Glumes 6, 2 outer small

large, very thiu. Stamens 4. Styles short, distinct. Graiu enclosed
in the larger glomos but free from them.

'l'he genus is limitsd to Australis. It is closely slliad to the South African Etrtarea
with which F. Mueller, following Sprengel, unitas this and the preceding genus, but
the dimerous not trimcrous androecium, together with the geographical range, appear
sufficient to maintain them as distinct. .
