Theseepecimeus heve been identified by Munro with the Indian onee described
by Neee under the name of P. sapae, they eleo closely resemble some South American
specimene of P. interruptus, H. B. et K. They can scarcely beoonsidered aea
short-evned variety of P. monspeh'eneir, and perhaps corne neerer to the similarly
short-evron P. littoralia, Sm. 'Ibe latter is however usually a perenninl with a
smnller spikelike pauide, end the glumes narrow and scarcely lline long. A
specimen from Ravenevvood in Tasmenia, in Herb. F. Mueller, is very near the true
P. littoralis, but is probably only an introduced wced.
