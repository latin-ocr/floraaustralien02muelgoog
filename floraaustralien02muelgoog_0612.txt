Spihelets few-flowered sessile or nearly so in the alternate notcbes
of the continuous rhachis of one or two simple secund spikes, the
rhachis of the spilrelet articulate above the 2 outer glumes. Outer
empty glumes ἱ), glabrous, acute, many-nomed, uuawued. Flowcring
glumes silky-hairy, 3-lobed, the centra] lohe withs broad bose tapering

into a straight or curved not tuisted own, the latenl lobes ercet, rigid,
2- or 3·nerved. Pelea with 2 prominent ciliotenerves or keels. Styles
distinct, very short. In both species the spihesore usually single, very

0 rarely 2 together at the ond of the peduncle.

The genus is limitcd toAustralia. It is certainly nearly sllisd to micuit,
bnt the terminal nntwisted own or control lobe of the glumes places it emungat
Pappophorem‚ whilst the inflorescence is rather that of Chloridos.

Spilrelcts closely imbricato ou one side of e secund splke ol'
atooin. Awn aboutas longasthe loterel lobes . . 1. A. pectinata.

Spikelets at some distance, almost ercet in a secund spine of
ttooin. Awn much longer than the loterel lobes,

straight or hoolred ............. 2. A. adeleida.

shcatbs. Leaves llat, ending in long points, smootb or scarcely
scabrous. Spikclets sessile in the alternate uotcbos ol'u secund spihe

4to 5 lines long, glabrous, acute, 9· or llnerved, with scarions
margins. Flowering glumes 3 or 4, the entire part scarcely l line long,
densely villous outside as well as the broad base of the middle lobe;
lateral lobes semilanceolate, glabruus, rigid, stoa lines lon , acute, lt
or 3-nerved‚ with the outec margin broadly scarious; control debe broad.
ovate, concavo, keeled tepering into a slender straight own aboutas

articulate only above the outsr glumes, very ha' between the lloworiug
ones, continued ond less hairy above the pe eet flowers with one or
two glabrous glumes aud peleae empty or with rudimentary llowera-
