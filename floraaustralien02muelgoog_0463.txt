racters to be assigned to them. Brcwn relied chiefly on tho position ot'tha fertile

strictly congessere, such as Aprostir from Dsymeia, Patrem from Chilcclloa Ais-n
from Dearhumpaia, or even still more closely ullied speciesasin Cyoidon. Fries has
proposed another character, adopted by sonae modern bounists, for tha two groups,
which bc terms Cleanthea and Eece-pontiae, tho former with the spikelets closed in
dovor, the stigmas protruding from the top ei the iloweriug glunic, the latter with
the spilrelets open in flower, the stigmas protruding attha sides or base oi the
ssowering glunic. But not only is this character practically useless as it can only be
observed on the living plant, many grassae only opening for a few hours in the day,
and has indeed been verified only on a certain number of species inhabiti temperate
regions. but it munet beoconatant in tropical musas, ior Ι bavo seen duilispecimens

Munro, while admitting that both tlic above muscam are general. though not
constant, has rolied chiefly on a third, which proves to be amuch safer practical
guide, the articulation ol the rhachis oi the spilrelet below tho outer lurnes (on the

connect the two grem series.

The arrangement hero odo ted of the tribes and subtribos is derived generally
