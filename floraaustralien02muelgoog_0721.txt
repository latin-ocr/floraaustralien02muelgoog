It is possible that the stndy of living specimens in their native staticus may show
characters for distinguishing moro than ons specics, but as far as known the
differenoes in the trnnks do not correspond with the very indefinite differences in the
fronds. In the typical Α. castratis, chiefly from N. S. Wales andTasmania, but
also among Queensland and Norfolk laland specimens, tho ultimate pinnulas are thin
rather acute barren and serrulate at tho end, theseri not reaching beyond the
middle. In the Norfollr Island form originally described as A. excelsa, the pinnulas
are longer, namanes, abiasar, obtuse with recurved margins, soriferous and entire or
obscurely crenatsto the end. But some Norfollr Island specimens are the precise
counterpart ef Brown's from King's Island. The Queensland specimens which gava
riae to the A. cooperi are generally intermediate between the two, merc frequently
