CONOLUDING PREFAOE.

Is bringing the present work ιο a close it had been my intention, rs
announced in the Preface to the first volume, to have supplemented
it with an account of the species added to the Australian Flora during
its progress, and a detailed examination of the relations as well of
the whole flora ιο thatoi other countries‚ as oi its component parts to

each other. Ι now, however, find that this would entail more labour
than at my age* it would be prudent to undertake. The additional
species have, moreover, been described by Baron von Mueller in his
Fragmenta; and itis to be hoped that, in order ιο render these
description· readily accessible to those who have ιο make use of my

opportunity of re-arrangiug my gencra with reformed characters in
those cases where his views have proved to be at variance with mine.
With regard ιο Geographical Distribution,1 can only repeat that

recent discoveriea and the additional data collected have generally
confirmed the principles laid down by J. D. Hooker in the admirable
Essay prefixed to his ‘Flora Tasmaniae‚' and that it is only in minor

details that corrections or additions have now to be made ιο ἱι. These
