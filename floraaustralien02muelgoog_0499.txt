'l'he shape of the spilrelets and glumas would suggest that this might be a very
reduced form of P. aeramentum, but none of the rather numerous specimens show
any tendency to a further development and there is no vertige 01 0 palea in the 3rd
giumo. Itis doubtfully referred by F. Mueller, Fragm. viii. 195, 10 P. hyprooharia
Steird, au Abyssinian plant named P. paludosam by Hoehstetter and publishad as P.
aquilarum by A. Richard, but thetis the common P. repens, readily known amongst
other characters by the male flower in the 3rd giumo. 1 have not seen the typieal
specimen received by Trinius from Lindley 00 from Port Jackson, but the descrip-
tion given by Trinius, as vvell as that 01 N ees in Mart. st. Bras. ii. 113, taken from
the same specimen. leave no doubt as to its identity.

48. Ρ. bicolor, R. Br. Prod. llll—Usually a small slender tufted
grass, with much the habit of some species of Airo or 40101110, but
sometimes above 1 ft. high, approaohing in habit the P. meloaaatham.
Leaves linear, usuall very narrow, more or less bairy especially at the

eiliate. Paniclc usually only 2 or 3 iu. long, loose aud slender but

capillary and flexuose, not clustered aud not much divided. Spilrelets
all pedicellate, about 1 11110 long, glabrous. Outer glume acute,
