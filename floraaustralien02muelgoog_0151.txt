the rapha sometimes variously ramilied. Albumen hard cartilaginous '
or white and brittle‚ entire ruminate or excavated on one side. Embryo
small in a small cavity either basal and near the hilum or dorsal and
more or less distant from it.—Woody plants either with long veah or
climbing stema and alternate leaves, or with an ereet stem or caudex
often very tall vvith a terminal crovvn ol large leaves which in deeaying
leave the stem covered with scales or fibras, or marked with aunular
soars. Leaves large, either pinnately or palmately divided into long
lohes or segmenta, rarely bipinnate. Flovvers usually numerous and
small lor the plant, in simple spilres orbranehed penicles called 00011010,
usually pendulous aud ansing from amongst t e leaves or from the
trunk below them, and at first entirely enclosed ina large braot called 0
spatha, opening laterally aud finally deciduous with frequentlyl or more
smallers eathing braets below the spatha, and rareiy none but sheathing
braetsbelow or on the rhaohis of 1110 spadix. Flovvers usually sessile
along the rhachis or branches of the spadix, often especially the males
2 together from the same node or noteh‚ subtended by 1 or 3 small bracts
not unirequently reduced to 0 slightly raised margin of the node.

Thia splendid order, the pride of all tropical regions, is restricted in Australis to
1011 speeiesand almost eonflned to Amhem’s land and Quaenslaud, only four 'es
extending into Nevv Sonth Wales, one of them penetrating as far south as i ps’
Laud, besides three speeiesendemie in Lord Howe'sIslaud. Noneol theAus '
generabat the majority of tha s cies are eudemio, most of them congeners and
nearly allied to the Palma of 1110 yan Archipelago or ol New Caledonia.
