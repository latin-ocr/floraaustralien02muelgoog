The above deseri tion vves taken from M‘Gillivray’s very good specimens, inii.
Brown's the brancies of the paniole are longer with a lew empty bracts below
thore subtending the pedicels. I could not verity the internal structure of the
ovary, but to all appearance it war as in hl‘Gillivray’e. The speciosis evidently
quite deunce from Δ. marinarum.

5. Α. μωὶιιοω, B. Br. Prod. 276-Rarely quite glabrous,
usually with a scabrone pubescence at least onthe leaf-rheaths and
some long hairs or cilia on the margins of the sheaths and base oi the
leaves. Fibrous rootsoften much thichened, almost tuberone. Radical
leaves tufted, grass-like, with short broad sheaths, mostly3 or 4 in.
long, but iu ve luxuriant specimens at least twice that length, vary·
ing from Bor ines broad aud tapering toa long point to very nar-
row almost subulate. Sterns erect, 6in. to nearly 2 lt. high, with lew
long leaves dilated into short sheaths. Panicle ve irregularly aad
loosely branched, rarely much longer than broad,o n forked at the
base but the branchos otherwise simple, long or short, on a flexuose
rhaclris, the pedicels rather dmtarm along the branches with a acaricus
brsct ander each. Outer peneum-segmenta varying from under3
lines to nearl 4 lines, the inner ones longer, usually pale hlne and
much veined, lut in some specimens appearing of a different colour
without conspicuous veins. Filaments all boarded, avith perfect
anthera, 3 with small abortiva ones. Ovary coellec, with 4 or 5 ovules
in esch cell. Capsnle oblong or avoid, rather longer than the periauth.
