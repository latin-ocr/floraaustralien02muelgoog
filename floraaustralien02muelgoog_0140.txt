Perianth ol 6 equal glume-lilre segments. Stamene 6, 3 attached to
the base of the inncr segmenta 3 alternate with them, all shorter than
the perianth; filaments filil'orm ; anthers oblong or linear, ercet, emar·
ginate at the base. Ovary sessile, l·celled, with 3ovules creet srorn a very
short centralplacenta3 style single, with 3 usually long and slender
stigmatic lobes. Capsnlc 3·valved. Seeds 3 or fener by abortion, erect,
the very short central placenta usually connected witha slightly raised
line in the centre ol' each valve, globular or avoid, the testa minutely
reticulate-striato with a very thin externsl hyaline membrane connected
nith the somevhat dilated sunicle and sometimes shortly produced·
beyond the seed. Embryo small, near the hilum, in anindenture os the
almost farinaceous albumen—Perennis} herbe, usually tulted. Leaves

raes-like, chiefly mdical, often fringed with long line white hair-s.

{lovers clustered or distinct, the clusters in irregular unequally
branched comporrnd umbels or penicles sometimes contractcd into
beceda, each flower subtended by a scarious bract and enclosed at the
base in l or 2 broad short eenricus bracteoles.

The genus. nearly allied to Juaear, is similarly spread over the greater part ol tha
globo, chiefly abundant in temperate regions and more common in voods and pas·
tures than in marshes. Of the three Arrstralian species or varieties, one is cos·
mopolitan, the tvo others emendenda, at least in the precise Austrshan form.

1. L. mensuit, Ilook. f Fr. Tarm. i't 68.-Considered by F.
Mueller as a variety ol' L. campestres, but ean scarcely be joined with
,ir unless that species be made to include the northern L. spicata as
well as the South American L. persciens and others generally admitted
as distinct. Habitof the corupact forms ol L. canapestrie, bet the tnt‘ts
more dense and the leaves themselves much broadcr‚ varying l'rom 2 to
4 lines, with the serve-like margin very prominent. Irrllorescence very
compact, more or less command, l‘ormiag an ovoirl or almost globular
slightly lobed head of ᾗ· te l in. diameter. Perianth-segments very
acute, the sizc el those of L. campestris or· rather longer. Secds rather
ovoicl than globular.

almost identical with it is referred to the sarna species hy J. D. llocker.

L. castratorem, Sterul. Syn. Glrrm. ii. 294, from :lustralia Durrle, is nn·
known to me ;l'r0m the dia-ramis given it may be the compact tlewering form of L.

gilimere, or, from his courparing it to L. chileruir, more probably tha same as L.
