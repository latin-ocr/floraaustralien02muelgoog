Perianth persistentes 6 distinct spreadiug segmenta, all equsl and
similar· Stamene 3, attached ιο the base of the segmenta or almost
hypogynous, shorter than the perianth; filaments filiform, dilated to·
wards the base; anthera ovete-oblong, versatile, the cells opening later·
ally in longitudinal slits. Ovary sessile, 3·callcd, with rather numerous
ovules in each oell; styles 3, distinet or united at the base, shortly
filiform, recurved, stigmatic along the inner edge at least towards the
end. (lapsule prominently 3·angled, opening loculicidslly in 3 valves.
Seeds small, globular, the testa thin brown and appressed; albumen
fleshy, rather hard. Embryo small, near the hilum—Small herbs, the
base of the stem and persistent brown leaf-sheaths thickeued into a
narrow tunicated bulb. Leaves few, huear, the uppermost reduced toa
broad loose sheath and short lamina or point. Flowers often more or
less dicecious, either solitary aud terminal or sessile along the rhachis of
asimple spilse. Bracts none.

from 1 ιο 3 cr aventin. long, the lowest sometimes narrow from the
base, the others more or less dilated at the base into a broad lcose
