Oenea CXXXVII. LEMNAGEAE.

Floating plante, without distinct stems or renl leaves, but consisting
of small sometimes minute leaflihe fronde, either separate or cohering
2 or 3 together by their edges, omitting in most species one or more
libres from their under surfece into the water, and multiplying by eimi-
lar fronde growing out of their edges. Flowers very rare, appearing
from a fissure in the edge or upon the upper suriace of the frond, and

consisting of a minute membraneus bract or spatha, enclosing l or 2
stamens and a single every. Perianth none. Filameuts usually shortly
exserted, anther l· 0r2- celled. Ovary l·celled, with 1 or more ovules.
Style short, with a slightly thichened stigma. Fruit a minute utricle.
Seeds 1 or rnore, with or without albumen.

The (tides, usually limited to the two genera represented in Australis, is widely
spread orer the giobo in ponde or standing waters. 'l'he Australian species, if cor·
rectly identified, here all a wide range, at least in the Old World. There is how-
ever considerable difficulty in deterrnining man of the specimens preserved in
herbaria, as they are not in irucnflcation. e Lemnaceee hare indeed been
recently worked up with great careby Professor F. Hegelmaier, of 'itihingen in an
elaborate treatisc illustrsted by lt platee (Die Lemnacsen, Leipzig, 1868, sto), but
the characters given to distinguish the species independently of the fructification
cannot well be practically ascertained without a patient study with the sid of a
powerful microscope. lhnve therefore hera confined mysels to the more obvious
distinctions of the principsl species without entering into the minute particulare by
which some of the Australisn forms might be separated,r referring for further
details to Hegelmaier's work, which must be consulted byall those who would maire

a special study of these curione organisms.
