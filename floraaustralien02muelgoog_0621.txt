1. Ο. unispicca, F. Maeli. Frapm. vii. 118.-A slender grass, from
6 in. to above l ft. high, glabrous except long heire at the oriflce of the
chaath, branching at the base and dansely tuited. Leaves short, scta·
cecus, crowded at the base of the stem, the upper ones few and capil-
lary. Spita single, ercet, unilatcral, 1} to 4 in. long. Outer glumas
very narrow, hyalino, acuminate, the lowest about 1} lines, the and at
least 2 lines long. Flowering glume on a hairy stipes, narrow, thin,
faintly 3·nerved‚ tapering at the top, nearly as long as the outer glume,
entire, with a fine awn of 2 te 3 lines. Terminal empty glumenarrow,
with a fine awn sometimes as long as, sometimes much shorter than
