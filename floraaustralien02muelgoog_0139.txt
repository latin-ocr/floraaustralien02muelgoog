Stems usually clustered‚ erect or ascending‚ flexuose with short alten
numerous branches‚ mostly about 1 lt. high, covered vrith the sheatlrs
of old leaves. the whole plant more or less ubescent or almost gla-
brous. Leaves crowded on the short annales, linear-subulale, very
acute or augent-pointed, 4 to 8 lines long, almost 3·quetrous towards
the end, diriter below the middle, the persistent sheaths closely em-
bracing the stem, the upper ones passing into the floral bructs.
Flowers terminal solitary and sessile. Perranth-tube closely encased
in sheathing bracts, shorter than the lobes, almost always pubescent
at the base and sometimes all over; lobes blue, often turning reddish·
browu in dryiug, varying t'rom under 4 lines to above 6 lines in length,
lanceolata rigid and horizontally spreading both during and after
llowering, when old lesing their colour or turning brorvn especially
along the centro. Perianth·tube slightly thickened when in fruit,
but the flower not otherwise enlarged.-Endl. lconogr. t. 38 (not
