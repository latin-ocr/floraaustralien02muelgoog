Widely spread in East Indis. Thia appears to be the true Agrestis dieadra oi
Rata aad Khnig, as determined by Kunth and othere, and as represented by Kenig's
specimens in the British Museum, although in Indian ss wellas in Auatrelian
specimens thore are generallyss etamens. The Vilsa disemo. Trln. or decretales
diaaader, Jaoq. l. Ecl. Gram. t. 28, is a different plant described and figured irem
gardan specimens having the end empty glume *as long as the flowering ene and

probably more constantly diandrous.

ln general this species is very distinct from S. pulchellus, both in foliage and in
epikelets, bnt some specimens os Bowmau's seem almost te connect the two. They are
however iaradvanced and not perfect Mitchell’s are also lar advanced and not so
characteristic as younger ones.
