awnless spilrelets in more regular apr es. and tho absence of any bristles on tho

27. P. crus-galli, tina-s coarse decumbant annual, ascending
to l or 2 lt. the leaves rather broad, without any ligula. Paniele dense
and usually secund, of simple branchos or sessile spikes, the lowest l
to 2 in. long, the upper ones gradually shorter, the whole panicle in
sanie varietres densely hispid with the long purplish or green awns.
Spilselcts about l} lines long, more orless uhesceut, acuminate or
named, crowded and clustered along the branehes, the rhachis usually·
bearing numerous cilia or capillary bristles amongst or below the
spilrelcts. Outergluine very short and broad, 2nd and 3rd glumas
nearly equal and 3-nervcd‚· usually ciliate on the margins, the 2nd
produced into a rather short awn, the ard in the conrmon Australian
form withan ann varying from ᾗ to 1 in, and a thiu palea and very
rarely a rnale flower in its aril. Fruiting gloom smooth and shlning,
without any or only a very short point-R. Br. Prod. 191 ; F. Muell'

long-awned state of the plant, but oceadonally with the awna short or reduced to
short points as ia frequently the case in Europe. ,

P. laoavrariam, F. Muell. in Trans. Vict Inst. 1865, 47, from around tha lagoena
of the Murray, is reduced by F. Mueller, viii. 198, to a variety of P. cras- alh'. 'l'he
pariclo is narrower than usual with fewer rnore distant branches, no cilia on the
rhachis, the spikeleta rather large, mostly about 2 lines long, without awns and
glabrous or the nervos minutely scabrone, and there appears to be always a molo
flowerin the third glume. Tho specimena muchreaemhle a few of thc avvnless
Europcan onos, but tho above characters may possibly prove wastant.
