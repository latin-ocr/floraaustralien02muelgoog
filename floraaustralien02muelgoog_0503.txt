Munro thinks thet the Quoansland plant may reve to be distinet from the mera
southern ene. The two, however, must be cles y allied and readily distinguished
from all others of the group by the much longer ligula not ciliato.

(Orthopegon, Β. Br.)

Spikelets with lterminal hermaphrodite flover and arudinrentary
ene below it, ewned, clustered along the secund distant branchos ot' a
simple panicle. Glumes 4, the lowest empty one not much shorter
then the others aud with alonger awn, the flewering glume awnless
arrdhardened with the palea round the grain as in Persicum.

A small tropical and subtrepieal genus common to the Now and the Old Werld,
and very closely alliod te some ol the awned species of Panicum, to which several
botanists would restore it. Theintlerescence, together with the greater develop-
ment und long awn ef the outer empty glume, may however suffice te retain itas
distinct, with the limits originally assrgned te it by Beauveis end by Brown. une
Australian species are both-of thom of a very wide distribution.
