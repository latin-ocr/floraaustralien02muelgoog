Fertile spikelets l-flowered‚ intermixed with sterile ones in little
clusters on the very short branchos of an unilateral spikelike penicis,
the rhaohis of the spikelet glabrous inarticulate and produced abore
the doner, bearing a narrow empty awnlilre glume and sometimese
and rudimentary one above it. Outer empty glumes awnless, floreno
one with a small dorsal awn. Sterile spikelets longer, with severi
truncate awnless empty glumes above the 2 outer acuto ones.

· Tho genus is limited to a single speciss, a native oi the Mediterranea region, end

perhaps not really naturalised in Australia. It only differs from Cynosurae in ns
iert1lo sprkelets, containing only a single flower maudo? 2 οι· more.
