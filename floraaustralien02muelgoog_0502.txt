examined. Some of tha norrenses-leaved Australisn specimons differ also in the
rather smallor spikelats with the outer glume not quite so truncate, but all ara
probably one species. Munro is also of opinion that tho North American P. genicula·

lower ones usually verticillate‚ scabrone aa well as the rhachis. Spihe·
