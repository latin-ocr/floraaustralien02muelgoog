with still finer leaves. Panicle loose with long capillary branchos,
or contracted in some of the smaller specimens. Outer glumes very
acute, about l line long. Flowering glume shorter, broad hyaline and
remarkably truncate, enveleping the hewse, with a dersal twisted awo,

nllixed very near the base and protruding beyond the enter glumes.

Spikelets l-flowered‚ pedicellate or rarely sessile in a panicle either
leese and spreading or narrow and spikelilre, the rhachis os thes iho-
let articulate above the outer glumas, usually bearing a tuft ef heire
round the fleuering glume and usually produced beyond it in a small
ciliate or rarely glabreus bristle very rarely bearing an empty lume or
imperfect flewer, sometimes very minute, rarely deficient. Glumes 3,
2 euter ones persistent, keeled, unawned; flowcring glume shorter and
very thiu, about as long er rarely longer and membraneus, broad,

enclesing the flower, 5·nerved, with u fine dorsal awn usually bent and
twisted‚ rarely short and straight or very rarely deficient. Palea thin,
more thau half as long ss the glonna, l'aintly or prominently 2-nerved.
Styles distinct, short. Graiu enclosed iu theglume and palea and some·
times partially adhering to them.

A considerable genus spread over the warmsr and temperate regions both el the
Now andthe Old Werld. of the fifteen Australian speeies three are also in Now
neolone, tho remainder ere apparently all eudemio. They are frequently regarded
as forming a section of Agrestis, from which they differ chiefly in themora
developed paleo and in the usual presence oi the bristle centinning the rhschis ef
tho spilrolet whilst others again reler Dsymeia te the supposed distinct tribe Arun-
diaeo, on account of the hairs surrounding the dowering glunic. But these hairs
aro present in almost all speciosos Agrestis, and although in many speciesof
Deyeusia they are longer, yet they are never se long as in Calamoyroatia snomhern
genus closely allied beth to dyrestis and te Dsymeia, and equally referribls to
Agrestideoe, whilst Arunda and Phreosuiles would appear to be much better placed
in Festucaeere. The bristle centinning the rhaehis behind the palea, though the
character generalty relied en fer separating Deymia hom aaronis and constantin
mest speeies, is usuallybutnot constant] wanting in D. qmdrisetasnd ite allisa,
distinguished by Nees under the name eddremidium, bnt evidently very closely oon·
nocted with other speeies where the bristle rs constant.
