rather glaueous much-branehed grass. Leaves long and narrorr.
Pnniele usually of 3 or 4 simple distant hranches, at first erest but
soon spre'ading, and at length reflexed like those of P. dielaahyana but
the rhachis generally though not alivays dinted, produced into a rigii]
point beyond the last spihelet, and bearing under the lowest spikeleta
rigid linear bristle (an abortire branchi‘) as long as the spihelet.
Spihelets not numerous, alternate and ‹listaut along the rhschis so as
to appear in one row, ovoid-oblong, fully 2 lines long in sorno speei-
