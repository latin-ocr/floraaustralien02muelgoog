islanda of the South Pacific, bnt not to any great extent. More
Australian types appear to be represented in Navv Caledonia than New
Caledonian ones in Australia.

6. Introduction, as it were occidental, from various countries,
very sparingly from natural causes from time immemorial, more
rapidly through human agency direct or indirect since European
colonisation has set in. Many European weeds and escapes hom cul-
tivation are becomiug common in the Eaeteru coloniens few plante
commonly cultivated by Malays have established themselves in North·
east Australis. South african weeds find a more genial home in the
south-western districts. Very few American species have been im·
ported excepting through Europe or South Africa.

7 . Α lew plaute, very different hom any genuine nostr-alian types,
but identical or closely connected with species at home in far distant
countries (N orth or Western America, East Mediterranean region, etc.)
were met with by the first explorare of inland districts, under conditione
which precluded any idea of recent introduction. These have been
chiefly either annuale or herbaceous or even shrubby or arborescent
species known to propagatereadily by seeds, produced in abundance
and apparently retaining for a long time their germinating power. 'Pha
appearance of these plants in Australis is, however, in some instances
not readily explained.

The principal features of the inland distribution of the indigenous
flora, the remarkable isolation and highly differentiated characteres
that of tha south-west corner, its continuity and the gradual connec-
tion and change ol species, systematic as well as geographical, down
the eastern side from Queenslund down to Tasmania, and the wide
spread of many desert species from Dampier's Archipelago to Spencer's
Gulf and from the Murchison to the Maranoa, have long since bean
pointed out, and have since been confirmed by all recent observa·
tiens.

Δ few other general characteristics of thedoro may be adverted to,
such as the absence os any Bambuseae or Equisetacese, the paucity of
ll'ilices in the western moiety whether tropical or extratropical, and
the very small number of endemic Filices in the whole region.
