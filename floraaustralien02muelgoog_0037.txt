long as the albumen—Shrubs or trees, the branchos marked by the
annulae soars of the fallen leaves. Leaves crowded under the paniole or
more or less spread along the branohes, long and narrow or short and
broad, petiolate or nearly sessile, with short imbricata sheaths. Penioles
terminal or sometimes axillary, the flowers usually smaller than in

Dracone, solitary or olustered along the bramber, sessile or pedioellate‚
eaoh within a small braot with 2 small braoteoles at their base.
