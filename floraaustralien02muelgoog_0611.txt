Evidently a very common plant and most vamable in aspectans it seems at urst
most difficult to unite the small sleader P. qracilc, Bm, with a leesor pale spikc and

rather narrow spihelete with the stouter larger typical durh-coloured plant with
dense cylindrical spilrcs, but, on going through the long series ot specimens before me

in different stages of development Iiailed in sortinglthem into distinct varietics. and

felt obliged to follow F. Mueller in regardingt em all as one species, with the
exception of the following about which I feel some doubts.

near the P. myricam with which F. Mueller unites it underthe

panicle looser with fewer aud larger¹ spihelets. Outer glumes
fully 3 lines long, with numerous nervos, usually more than ll
and sometimes as many as 21. Flowering glumes several, closel
imbricato, the outer oues with a fertile flower enelosing lor2witli
