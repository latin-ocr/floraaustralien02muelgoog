cave, from under 1 ft. to nearly 2 ft. long, the scarious imbricato
sheething bases rather long but very narrow. Seape slender, very
variahle in length, but always shorter than the leaves, the infloroseeuee
simple or slightly branehed. Male-flowers pedicellate in sessile clusters
along the rhachis, the broad scarious bracts shorter than the filil'orm
pedieels. Periantlr-segmeuts all free, ovate-oblong, thin and light·
coloured vvith darker centres, varying from a little more than l line to

Filaments 3 attached to the base of the inner segmenta, 3 alternating
with them. Ovary rudimentary. Female infloreseenee simple, the
floners sessile and t'err in the clusters. Perianth nearly 2 lines long.
Ovary very prominently 3·angled, tapering into a short style with
