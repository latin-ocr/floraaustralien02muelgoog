The Linnean names P. gramineas and Ρ. compresse have been so variously applied
to thisand the following species, as well as to the varieties of some of the hetero-

ph llous speeies vvith the leaves all submorged‚ and the s ecies vareso vaguel

have followed most medem authors in takin up the species at first correctly defined
by German botanists andsnppresaing entirely the Linnean names.
