Besides the Australisn species, which are probably ull eudemio, there are a iow in

Wendland and Drudo place Ptyctoeperma and Arctontoptoenic in a division with
tho ovnlos laterally attached their whole length, and Beccari in his character both oi
Kentia and of Ptychospmna describes the ovule as parietal. Both appear to have
overlooked the important exceptional character of Ptychosperma, well pointed out by
Blume, ol the ovulo pendulous hom the apex, whilst in Kortia it is erect from the
base, a character vhreh Ihave verified in ullthe Australian species of the two genera
of which 1 have had the female flowers.
