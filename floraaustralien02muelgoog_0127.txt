the greater part 61 their length by anarrow scarious margin broken up
’ into reflexed serratures and sometimes wearing 611, from the older
leaves. Sospes rigid, proceeding from the imbricata scaly base of the
atock by the side of the leaf-tufts, about l ia high, bearing a single
umbel or cluster of arrrnerous floners, the very numerous scarious
imbricata bracts and very broad bracteolas t'orming an abavoid 61
globular head 3 to 41 lines diameter. Pedicels filiform‚ 2 or 3 times aa
long as the bracts. Perianthsegments marrow, about 2 lines long.
Stamene nearly as long, with ovate anthers. Ovules apparently perfect
in all the flowers examined.—Xeratas sarra, Endl. inP . Preiss. ii. 49.

Flowers hcrmaphrodite. Perianth 61 6 segmenta, all equal, thia
almost hyaline witha more opaque centra. Stamene 6, 3 attached to the
base af the inner segmenta, 3 alternate with them; anthera versatile,
lobcd at the base, the cells opening inavardly iu longitudinalsiits. Ovary
sessile, toperiag into a short stylo with a small stigma, 3-celled, with
lovulc laterali attached in each cell. (1111661611611116131111611,
