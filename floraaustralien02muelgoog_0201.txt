The specimens in Brown's herbarium haro no lebel indicating their station. 'l'hey
have no fructification, but Kilncr’s specimen in F. Mueller's herbarium in fruit isin
other respecta precisely similar. The species is certainly very different from Η.
stipalacca to which Ascherson (Linnaee, xxxv. 172) thought it might belong frum
Brown's short disgnosis. F. Mueller, Pnagm, viii. 219, pro s it ns a new genus
under the name of Ascharaom'a, but that name is preoccupi in Fungi, and the fruit
and soeds of our plant agree so wsll with those of neophita, that it does not seem
worth while to separate it gcnericnlly on account of the foliage which is far from
unilorm in what are admitted as true speciosos Halophc'lo.
