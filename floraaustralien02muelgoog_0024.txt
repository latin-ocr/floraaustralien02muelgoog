twists and llnally dimrticulates st some distance troni tho lamina, and oblong or
linear nmsparsnt dots on tholani mixed with the ordinary small ones, whilst in S.

close to the lamina, and has only tho ordinary mnall dots. But aiter careiully oom-

parts oi the petiole, and the exact place where the lamina breaks off ; tha dotting oi

Flowers hermaphrodita. Perianth decidnms, oi 6 distinct spreading
segmenta, all equal or the outer ones shorter and often, but not always,
sumoanded by 2, 3, or even 4 small braots. Stamene 6, hypogynous;
filaments short, somewhat flattened3 anthera sagittata, creet, nearly as
long as the periantb. Ovary sessile, hoelled, tapering at the top into a
very short style, divided into 8 thick recurved stigmatic lobes ; ovules
solitary in each cell, pendulous, orthotropons or nearly so. Fruit a
globular berry, usually ripening l globular seed, or sometimes 2 orii
seeds variously flattened, with a large hilum, without any strophiole.
Testa tbin, light brown, closely adnata to the hard albumen. Embryo
small, at a distance iram the hilum-'Pali branching climbers. Leaves
often mostly opposite or nearly so, but sometimes all alternatail or 5-
narved, with transverse reticulate veina, the petiolas without wings or
tendrssa Flowers sessile or shortly pedicellate, in racemos either simple
aud arillary or the appar ones forming a terminal leafless panicio.
