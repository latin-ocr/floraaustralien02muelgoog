Flowers dioecious. Moles: Perianth οἰδ segmenta or lobes all equal
and similar, free or united to the middle, or more frequently the 3 outer

shorter than the perianth3 anthers versatile, usually deeply lobed
below their attachment and sometimes at the apex also, the cells then
quite distinct aud dorselly attached, opening in longitudine] slits. Orary
