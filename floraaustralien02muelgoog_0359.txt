Some ol the Anetralien specimene are remarkable lor their very large umen blech
shining spikelet, in others it is light brown and shorter as in the majority ef Asiatio
specimene. They bear at flret sight a striking resemblance to the mammons genus

Bedeiocoleo, in which however, besides the intemnl structure, the spikelet is more ·

strictly terminal and creet.

Spikelete (or heads) solitary, laterai, with numerous hcrmaphrodite
