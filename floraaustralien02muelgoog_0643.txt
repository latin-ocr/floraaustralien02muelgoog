from under ll't. to 1} ft. high. Leavee chiefly at the base, narrow, ending
in subulate points. Panicle narrow and dense but more interrupted than
in Ε. leporina, often turned to one side,2 to t in. long. Spihelets not
ao crowded and longer, with few hairs on the pedioels. Outer glumes
scarcely l line long, thin and narrow. Lowest fiowering glume rigid,
lanceolate, distinctly 3·nerved, ll to 2 lines long, quite entire,
topering into a short awn, the next nearly similar but with a
longer awn and the flower male only, the upper tor 3 glumas narrower
