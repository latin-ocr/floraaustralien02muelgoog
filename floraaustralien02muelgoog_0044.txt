1. w.cnbn10sa‚ Baete-Belo and lower leaves unknown3 upper
leaf broadly lanceolate, eontraeted at the base and tapering into a long
point. Spike dense, ot above 10 flowers. Perianth 7 to 9 lines long, the
segmenta united ιο near the middle into a narrow tube; lobes acute,
without transverse glande. Stamene attached ιο the base os the lobes,
much shorter than them, with small anthera. Ovary in the flower
examined narrow, probably imperfect, with 8 long fililorm stylos.

W. Auatrslla. Champion Bay, Hert. F. Mueller, where there are only two
apileos, but the peculiar tlowers do not admit of referring them to any other speeies;
the perianth·tube is indeed longer then in any African oue except W. lenpfflera.

2. W. Drummondii, Bacch—A dwarf plant, none ot onr specimens
exoeeding 4in. Bulb tunicated, shining. Leaves 2 or 3, ovate or
lanceolata, acute but not acuminato, 1 to 1} in. long in our specimens
and 3 to 6 lines broad at the base. Flowers in a rather dense spike,
polygamous and usually small, but the perianth varying irem meere
to above 4 lines in length, the segmenta united to about lot their length.
Stamene attached ιο the base of the lobes aud shorter than them;
anthera small, shortly ovate. Styles scarcely longer ιιιοο the ovary.

W. Ameana. Swan River, Dremmoed, let coll.

3. W. pygmaea, Bentb.—Nearly allied ιο W. Dremmeedii and
stature as small, but the leaves much narrower‚ linear or linear-lanceo-
late, contracted at the base, flowers smaller, tewer in the spille, often
only 1 or 2, perianth-segments 6 (or very rarely a veh) scarcely united
ιο above l ot their length, ot a rather thiclr consistence, and glandular-

, dotted outside.-Aepeiilerie pypmea, Endl. in Pl. Preiss. ii. 45.

W. Ausmlla. Swan River, Dmenmeed, let coll, Protea n. 1⁶99.

4. W. tenena, Beate—A small slender plant, resembling at tirst
sight the slender l-tlowcred specimens of Anquillaria. dietae, the stem
almost filiform‚ with usually 1 long filiiorm leat and 1 or 2 shorter ones
scarcely dilated at the base. Flowers solitary and terminol in all the
specimens seen. Perianth-segmente almost always 8, very spreading,
narrow,about81iues long, with an orbiculat gland about the middle,
all shortly united at the base. Stamene shorter than the perianth, the
fflamencs much dilated and united in a ringet the base ; entheas small.
