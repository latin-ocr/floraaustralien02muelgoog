Besidee the three Australiun genera which are eudomio, the Order includes one
other, somewhat different in habit and inflorescence, ranging over New Zealand and
Antarctio America. The whole Order has been worked up with t careby
Georg Hieronymus in en elaborate memoir extrected irem the twel hrol. of the
abhandlungen der Notariorschenden Gesellschnft of lIalle. Ithink however
that the infloreeeence divides it into more natural genera than the teohnioal
ahamcnrs adopted hy Hieronymus, and I cannot agree with him in considering the
inlloroseenoe within the hraets aa e one-branched centrisu lcynne, called hy him a
σιόίηηω. The axis oi this inflorescence is so exmedingiyi short that it 1s very
difficolt to follow out its evolution accurately, but where it is a little more devo·
loped, as in t'cntreleps'sBanksii and 0. exserta, and in tho lowest hract oi aptent
Dromonendii, it appears to mo to be clearly a centripetal secund spike.
