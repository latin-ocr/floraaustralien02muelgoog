or less united at the base. Fruit dry, often hard, usually small, either 2-
01 30011011 and 2- or 3·angled, opemng along the angles, or l-cellad and
either opening along l-side, or an indehieceut nut. Seeds 1 in each

rugosa ; testa appressed; albumen usually mealy. Embryo small,
lenticulas or obovoid, at the base of the albumen, at the end
remote from the hilum—Herbe usually erennial, with a rusb-like
or sedge-lilse habit, either with a tufted 11000 01 hard horizontal or
creeping rhizome usually covered with closely-imbricata scales. Stema
simple or branched, ereot or flexuosa and variously twiated. heaves

none or few, radical and long linear or sedge-lilse, but the stema usually '

bear at the base several closely imbricata dry scales and higher upa
few sheathing scales the margins closed but not connata into a pylinder
at least at the base, occasionally open at the upper end an often
bearing 0011011 01 lengthened point or imperfect lamina, the upper
sheatha, under the infloresceuce and 110 branchos, transformed into
floral bracts, usually shorter, broader aud moreo eu than the atem·
sheaths and sometimes the last long broad an'd spathalilre. Spihelets
solitary or clustered and sessile or pedicellate within each fioral bract,
tha flowers when in spikelets sessile or very shortly pedicellate without
bracteolas and concealed under the glume, or when notin close spilre-
lets having usually but not always a pair of bracteolas at their base.

The order ia almost limited to extratropical South Ahioa, Australia and Now
