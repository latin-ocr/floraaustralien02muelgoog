Rhizome creepiug. Fronds compound, usually large, the innules
penniveined. Seri marginal, short, in the sinus of the teetb ol tbe

Alsa in the Malaysn Archipelsgo, the South Pscifio Islandsand New Zeslmd,
but notin Tasmanie. The sronds, especially in an advanced state ol fructificatior,
bear e striking resemblance te those ef Polypodr'em rrryrrlosum, end are sometimes cen-

the two plunts will I believe always be rsadily distinguished.

24. OHEILAN'I'EES, Swarta.

Rhizome tutted or creeping. Fronds usually small, twice or tbrice
pinuate with small lebed segmenta. Seri globular and distinct st the

A considerable genus widely spread over the tropicsl and temperate regions oi urs
