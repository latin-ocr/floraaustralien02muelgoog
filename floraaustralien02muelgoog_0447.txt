Flowers unisexual, in unisexual or androgynous spikelets. Glumes
imbricato all round the rhachis. Stamene in the males 3 or rarely
lower, withouth o ons bristles or scales. Ovary in the females
enclosed in a batt es ped or inflated utricle or perigynium, contracted
at the top, with a small oblique or 2·toothed arillae, and at the baseos
the ovary within the utricle is often a bristle (a barren pedicel) usually
very small, not hooked, rarely protruding from the utricle aud entirely
wanting in many s ecies. S le protrudiug with 2 or 8 filiform stig·

This genus, the largest among Cyperaceae, is abundant in the temperate and eooler
regienses both hemispharee and in mountainous districta withm the tropica, with a
lew speeies even ‘m the hotter regions. As a geum rt rs technieally separated from

The species are however very difficult to classrfy and deflua. Dr. Boott's 'rabie
