style filiform, with a small terminat stigma. Fruit unknown, probably
the same as in Karsten-Tnfted perennials‚ with the habit of some
species of Xerotes. Leaves mdical, rigid, the young ones bordered byn
scorious lacerated niargin. Seapes short. Flowers pedieellate‚ in
sessile eleatem, with short imbricato scarieus braets.

The genus islimited to West Australis, and hasbeen included in Karsten, from
which it differs in the flowcrs mostly hermaphroditae and the fililorm nadivided
