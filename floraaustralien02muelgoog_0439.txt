Common iu tropical Asia from (leylon to Honglscng and the Malayau Archipelsgo.
The close connection of this plant with Sele· r'o was suggested by Brown, but 111111
generically separated ou account ol the supposed homology of the 2 glomos 011le
the fruit with the perigyuium or utriole of Corsa, which however has been sinae
shown to be a mistahe. Tho habia ol the plaut is indeed very different from that ol
the larger species of serta, being thet of &honus willaris, but the differenee is not
greater then in Scaeam, and, as in that genus. thera istoo close a series ol intermediate
species to juatily a generis separation. ·
