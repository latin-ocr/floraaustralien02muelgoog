(Metiscus, Vavv. Pspyrus, mlta. Diclidium,Selrad.)

Spilrelets with several often numerous llowers rarel reduced to 3, 2,
or l, all hermaphrodite or the terminal flowerrarely male. Glumcs
distichous, concere or navicular and lseeled, all nearly e nal and flever-
ing except the lowest 2 or 1 usually smaller and empty. No
hypogynons scales or bristles. Stamene 3 οι fewer. Style continuone
with t e ovary, not thielrened at the base, decidneus, dee ly 'or shortly»
divided into 2 or 3 filiform stigmatis brenohes or rarely ost οι· quite
entire. Nnt sessile, without any hypogynous dish, flattened biconvex
or triquetrous, smooth or (frequently in the same species) minutely
granular.-Perennials either tufted or forming horizontal or cresping
rhizomes, rarely annuale. Stems simple under the infloreseence,
Leaves few at the base of the stem or rarely covering it half way up
with their sheatbs, long or short οι sometimes all reduced to the sheaths,
of which the lower ones are scale-like covering the rhizome or leaving
annular sears when they fall away. Spikelets in clusters heads or
spilses, very rarely solita at the ends of the rays or branchos of a
simple or componnd irregu ar umbel, sometimes oeeupying the whole of
the secondary rays, the central clusters or s'pilres always sessile in the
centre of the umbel, the rays very unequal and sometimes the whole
inflorescence eontracted into a dense sessile componnd cluster or head
oi spilrelets, the general rhaehis of the infloresoence rarel shortly
produced, showing an interval between each ray. Under esci ray isa

ersistent bract, one, two or more of the enter oues usually long and
lieni-like forming an involuere round theinfloresoence, the inner breots
and those which subtend the secondary rays and the spilvelets usually
small and scale-like, those nnder the spilrelets rarely entirely wanting.

A very large and widely spread genus, second in the Orderto eam onlyin point of
numbers, but rhnoh more prevalent than that genus in the tropioal and subtrepieal
regions both of the Nevv and the Old World where itiseverywhere abundant. Itis

The genus differs from those groups of Scirpas which having no hypogynous
bristles formed Brown's genus Iaolcps's, solsly in the distichous arrangement of the
glnmes, eud this character is not constantin cyperus pygmeos, whrlst in Scirpae
cyperos'des the gl umes ere often very nearly distichous. From ectetas it is generally
