generis connection with Africa, the great mass of purely Australian
specics and endemic genera, must have originatod or been dif-
ferentiated in Australis, and never have spread far out of it. vhe
only exceptione observed are a few Australian types (ay, Euca-
lypti, Epacrideae, Phyllodineous Aeacius, etc.) appearing in the Malayan
Archipelage‚ especially Timor, N ew (luinea and Borneo, where thcy have
established distinct though generally nearly representative speeies,
sometimes however preserving absolute identity, and a very few, chiefly
annual or herbaceous plante of various Australian genera, found as far
aa South China, mostly in identieal or very closely representative
species.

2. The principal Flora showing an ancient connection between
Australis aud other countries is the Indo-Australian. A number of
genera, whose main station is in tropical Asia, extend more or loss into
tropical and eastern sub-tropical Australis, sometimes in identical,
sometimes in more or less differentiated species, Tlrose of East
Quaeneland have generally an Enst Asiatic character. A few Ceyloneee
and Peninsular types are more specially represented in Arnhcm's Laud,
Scarcely any Indian forms are found ιο the westward of that Penin-

sula.
3. Νο less, if not more ancient, must be the connection of the

mountain Flora of Victoria and Tasmania with thegeneral southern ex· ’
tratropical and mountain region, extending through N ew Zealand to the
southern end of the American Continent, and thence up the Andes.
Many of the Australian speeies of this type are identical with or
closely representative of New Zealand ones, and some have amech
wider range. Itis probably through this connection thata few specics
belonging to the temperate or cooler floras of the northern hemisphere
have evidently, in very remote times, become represented in Australis.

4. Maritima plante, ranging at least from the Maecarene Islanda to
those of the Pacific, are also to be found on the Australian coasts,
mostly in identieal speeies, with the addition of a few representative
ones.

5. An eachauge has evidently tahon place in plante not strictly
maritime between North-east Australis and New Caledonia and other
