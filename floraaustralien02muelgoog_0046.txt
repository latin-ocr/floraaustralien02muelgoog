An exoeedingly variable specics, of which I bavo found it impossible to distribute
the numerous specimens before me, irom very varied localities, into distinct 16666,
either by general sizo or by that oi the perianth, by the more or less spathiiorm
upper leaves, by the number ol dovera, l, 2 or more in the spilre, by the colour oi

the segmento described aa yellow, with or without a purple margin, or almost wholly
purple, or by the union or distinctness oi the glande on their surlace.

Periantb deciduous, 61 6 distinct spreading segmento, all equal aud
similar. Stamene 6, hypogynous, very much shorter than the periauth;
authore ovata-oblong versatile, the 66116 opening laterelly in longitudinal
slits. Ovary 6666116, 6-661166, with rather numerous ovulee in each oell;
styles 6, very shortly united at the base, recurved, stigmatic along the
inner edge. (lapsule 1666 angular than in Aripriilluria, opening loculioid-
ally in 6 valvas. Scede small, globular, the testa thiu brown and
appressed; albumen fleshy. Embryo small, near the hilum-Herbe
forming a small tuuioated bulb, the stem simple, with few uarrow leaves.
Flowers few, ou long pedioels, or sessile in a speeies not Ausualian.

Besides the Australian species, which is widely distributed over East India, there
ars one or two others from East India, and one in Ncw Zealaud The genus is
closely alliod to Anquillaria, and was included in it hy R. Brown, difforing from it
