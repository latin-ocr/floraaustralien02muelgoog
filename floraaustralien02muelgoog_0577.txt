4. S. teretifolia‚ dread. Syn. Glum. i. 128.—Very closely allied to
&flavescam the stema iu dense tulta, 1} to above 2 ft. high. Leaves
long, slender‚ tereto or acicular‚ sometimes as long as the stem3 ligula ’
broad aad membraneus, entire, decurrent along the margins of the
sliesth. Panicle narrow, «ι ιο 8 in. loug, not so dense as in S. flaues-

above ᾗ iu. long, with scarioua tips. Flowering glume much shorter,
bairy, the upper hairs long aud at length spreadiug, the termiual lobes
on each sido of the awn more conspicuous than in &flavescam though

Alsa in New Zsalaud. 1 have seen no authentia specimeas of Steudel's plant, but
the character given agrees very fairly with our plant.

5. S. compressa, R. Br. Prod. lla—Stoma l to 2 ft. high but
often flowering when under 6 iu. Lower leaves with short slieaths and
lamina, the upper ones with long loose broad lamina, the upper one
embracing the base of the panicle; ligula 2 to 4 lines long, acute or
bifid, not eiliate. Panicle at first very dense, narrow, at length looaer,
. above 1 ft. long, with rather long erest filiform branchos. Outer glumas
often above ὲ in. long, tapering into fine points. Ploweringglume
shorter, pubescant, entire. Awn glabrous, very fine, 3 ιο 5 in. long.
