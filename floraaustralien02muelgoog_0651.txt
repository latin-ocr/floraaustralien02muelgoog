Spikelets several· usually many-donared, pedicellate or sessile in a
loose and spreading or narrew and clustered penicle‚ the rhachis of tha
spikelet usually glabrous and articulato under the flowering glumas,
but often very tardily so aud sometimes inarticulate. Outer empt
glumes unequal and rather shorter tbau the flevering ones, treated,
without any or only faint lateral nervos. Flovveriug glumas obtuse or
acute, unawned, 3-nerved, the keel prominent, the latera] nervas in a
few species very faint. Palea shorter thau the glume, with 2 prominent
nervas or keels, often persisting after the glume aud grain bave fallen
away. Grain free, ovoid or oblong‚ not lurrowed.

The genus iaas widely spread aa Peain warrn and temperate 'ona butdiaa pears
in cold countries and high mountains. Oi the nineteen annihilari species dvo at
least are common East Indian ones, one ot thern abundant also beyond the tropica in
the Old World, ona is also in New Zoeland‚ the remaining thirteen have net yet beeu
absolutely identified with extra Australian species, although some ol them as ob·
served by lllnnro are very closely connected it not identical with South African or
American species. 'l'be limita to be assigned however to some ol the variable oues
are as yet very uncertain, and in 1⁴¹. Mueller's collectione there are two or thiae mora
which may prove to be distinct species but of which the specimens are scarcely suffi-

cient lor identification.
