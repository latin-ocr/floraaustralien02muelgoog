and sessile at irem 2 or 3 to 6 or 8 in. below the top, the leefy hraot at
the baseos the inflorescence being ercet, terete, continuone with the
stem, and scarcely hollowed into a sheath et the base. Flowers nume·

or forming a looser very unaqunlly branched paniole of l to 2 in. hame-
ter flowermg from the base, the central short branches having only 2
or 3 flowers‚ the othere a considerable number, usually eingly scattered
along the brenohee of irregular cymes. Brects within the panicle small
and acaricus. Perianth nearly or quite sessile, the segmenta 'all very
acute, usually pule-coloured, above 1 line end under ll lines long.
Stamene in ell the flowers exemiued 3 only, alternating with the iuner

Australis. Apparently abundent wherever there are marshes or habituelly wet

places, especially without the tropica, the special localities recorded from each colony
are ier too numerous to he worth enumereting‚ the species extending also to most
temperate end sub-tropioel regione of the gleba. In suanm ar elsewhere there sre
two principel varieties, the J. conplecteretur, Line„ with the flowers closely pocked in
a dense head and nsnnlly more orless brown, and Ι. efferae, Lina, with the icles
looecr and pelercolonred‚ but every gradation may be obserwed between e two.
