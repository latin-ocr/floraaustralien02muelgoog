typioal form slender‚ tested, 1 102 ft. high. Leaves subulate 0111110111,
rather short, glabrous or slightly pubescent, the upper sheath scarcely
dilated3 ligula very short, more or less oiliate. ¹Paniole very loose, 6
in. to abore l lt. long, with long capillary slightly s reading glabrous
branohes and pedioels. Outer glumas at first almostlyalineet length,
especially in western specimens‚ often purplish or rigid, tapering into
long points, the longest about ᾗ in. long. Flowering glume about 2
lines long, silky-hairy‚ entire at the tip. Awn fine, glabrous,3 in. long
or inore. Palea nearly as long as the glume.

The speciae, distinguished 11011 S. eetoeea by the short fine ligula, from S. putea·
cens by the more slender habit, the outer glumas both with long fine points, and the
long fine anns, appears to be very abundant in the desert country and very variable.
