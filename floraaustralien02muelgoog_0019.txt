tuito, or crowded at the ends of tho caudex or branchos, but sometimes
spread along the branchos, their sheathiug bases distichons‚ or variously
imbricated, or scattered, and often persistent altor the blado has fallen ¹
away, the blado or lamina entire or minutely scabrousdentieulate, usually
marrow withparallcl veins, flat ohannelled or tereto, rarely broad with

dietam primary vcins and transverse veinlets. Scupos or flowering
stema or peduncles terminal or rarely axillary, leadess or with 1 ord
leaves below the inflorescenoe smaller thau the lower ones, and passing
into the bracts under the branchos of the inflorescence or podicels, which ,
are usually reduced to small scales, and sometimes entirely wanting.
Indorescence variously brauched or simple, usually centripetal, or
reduced to a single terminal dower. Perianth usually glabrons, very
variously coloured, olten blus, as well as red, white, yellow, or purple.

The Order, lilro the Amaryllida, is generally distnbuted over the warmer and
temperate regions ol the globe; most abundant in dry aunny countn'es. Oi the
40 genera here includedt are large genera widely distributed over the war-mer
regions ot the Old World, more or less represented also in Amerina and 2 oi them
extending into more temperate regions; 3, although chiefly Austruliau, extend into
tropioal Aria, and two oi them also to New Zealaud; 4 are Anstralian representa·
tivos oi South African genera, one of them exten ' into tropicul.Asia; 2, chiefly
Australian, οπο also found in New Zealaud or in the acilio Islauds; theloug to the
New Zealand aud Tasmanian alpino flora,l ol them widely distributed over the
extremo southern regions of the new aa well aa the old world; the remaining 24 are,
aa far aa hitherto known, strictly endemic, a large proportiou of thom, however,

oonsiatinp‘pnigonly one or tw0 species

Iu wor ' up this eomplicated and at flrst sight heterogeueous Order,1 hare been
greatly ussimed by llir. Balrer, whose vicws aa to ite comprehensivenen, aa given in
the serice ol monographs he is publishing in the Journal oi the Isinnesm Socicty, I
have mainly followed. The tribes and subtribes, however, which I have herc charae
terised, ure chiefly with reference to the Arrotralinn gauere, ο large proportiones
which οπο strictly or nearly eudemio, and would probably require ο somewhat
different arrangement in a general stem oi the whole Order, the limita ot which
ure iar from being defluitivcly settle . Many botuuisto would distribute theso Austra-
lion genera into 6 or 7 distinct Ordera, whilst on tho other hand the ehmaaers which
separate them from Junceoe are by no means without exception. Genarally speaking,
they differ from Arnorylls'dcoe in their troo ovar-y, and from ereeae by the petat-like
oonsistcucy oi both series oi the periauth and with very few exceptione by the sceda.
