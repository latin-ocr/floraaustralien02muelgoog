Spikelets l-llowered, nearly sessile in a dense panicle contrected into
au ovoid-globular head, the rhaohis of tbe epikelet articulate ebovethe
2 outer glumes ond not continued beyond tue flower. Glumcs 3, the
2outor oues persistent, hecled‚ topering into line short stroi ht awns.
Floweringglume scarcely raised above the outer ones, witi a rigid
terruinul awn spirally twisted and curved down, and a short straight
awuon eaob side of it. Palea as long as the glume, uarrow and
hyalino with 2 prominent nervos produced into short awns. Styles
distinct. Graiu not seen.

, The genus is limited to the single species endemio in Australis. It is in many
respecta nearly allicd to Amplr'poqon, among Pappophoreae, but the essentially
twistcd awn places it rather in Agrostideae nexttoPcntapoyow.
