long, the rhachis produced into a point usually excecding the spikelets
aud sometimes very long. Bracts under the spikes or pedunclea‘
lanceolata, acuminata, concava. Spikelets sessile in the spilre or
scarcely pedicellate, 5 to 6 lines long. Glumes membraneus, hai ,
the empty ones 5- or lnerved, vmually as long as or longer than t e
fleverim ones. Fertile plant: Spilrelets very numerous in a large
dense globular head, each one solitary at the base of a spine-like
rhachis of 4 in. or more, subtended by a much shorter linear-lanceolata
bract, the spikelet 6 to 7 lines long, acute or acuminato. Glumes all
nearly similar, with 7 οι· more nerves, the 2 outer ones rather
the largest with more nervas than the others. A palea and some·
timos 3 stameus in tlve axil of the 3rd, and an ovary and 3 stamens

S. alterniylorus, Nees in Pl. Praise. ii. 96, from the character given, would belcam
malaricus, but the specimens 1 have seen from vaan River, Preiss, n. 1⁸3³,
belong rather to S. lonyisoliur. Both species are in West Australis, but, as far as 1
have seen, S. lonyisolia stom the north down the west coast te Svran River, and 8.
airastus only en the south coast.

2. S. long-nelias, Β. Βν. Prod. 198.-Olcsely resembles U. hirsu-
tus but quite glabrous except the long eilia of the ligula and sometimes
a few cu the margins of the leel-sheaths. Leaves marrow, rigid, often
above l ft. long but not sc pungent as in the Asiatic ds canoras, of
which S. loayisolius may perhaps bea variety only. liele spikes
usually looser tlmn in S. hirsutas. Spilrelcts scarcely 5 lines long, the
enter empty glumes shorter than the flovvering ones. In the female
spikes the enter glomos quite as long as the incer ones, aud I found uo
