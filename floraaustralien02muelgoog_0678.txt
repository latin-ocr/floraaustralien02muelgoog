Australian specimens with very narrow leaves. Spilres nearly cylin-
drical, slender, uto 6in. long straight or curved. Outer glumee‘l,
rigid‚ acute, usually 5-nervcd, about 3 lines long, placed in the laterai
spilrelets apparently side by side outside the rest of the spikelet, but
one slightly overlapping the other ct the base. Flowering glume and
fiower embedded in the cavity of the rhechis of the spilre, the rhsehis
of the spikelet slightly produced behind the palea into a minute point,
sometimes almost obsolete. ln the terminal ilrelet the 2 enter
glrpmes are normally opposed to each other-fflichb. Ic. Fl. Germ.
