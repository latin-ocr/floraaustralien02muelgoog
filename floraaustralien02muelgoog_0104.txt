Most of the N. 8. Wales specimens and a-fsvv o'f the Quaensland ones have ,broadcr
leaves and larger hovers than Brovvn's typical ones from Hnnter’s River and nmen
Sound. Brown's A. affine (Prod. Ι271) from the north coast is a variety with narrovv
leaves, slender cles, and the capsnle 4 to 6 lines long. A. eatterieoides, Br. ho.
²ss horpaltlpe ‘ ds of the (iuli of Carpentaria, is intermediate between that and
t typi orni.

· 6. Α. stantem, It. Br. Prod. 271.-·Quiteglabrous. Fibrous roots
much thickened, almost tuberone. Radicel leaves tufted, linear or
linear-lanceolata, aith short broad sbeaths, 6 in. to 1 ft. long or even
more, tapering toa fine point. Stems ereot from amongst or by the
side of the leaf-tufts‚l to 2 lt. high or morein some Indian specimens,
with few shorter leaves dilated into rather long sheatbs, the uppermost
under the first branch of the inflorescenoe·rednoed to a sheathing
bract. Panicle simple or forhed at tbe base, each branch bearing 2 to
6 unilateral racemesflscorpioid when young, the lowest on a lon pe·
duncle the uppermost almost sessile on the common rhscbis. Pedicels
close above one another, the bracts reduced to a small tooth, leaving
in the old racemes a thichened closely denticulate rhachis. Onter

more, inner ones larger, ofa deep blue. Perfeci stamens 3 with
bearded filaments and rather large anthera ; staminodes 3with shorter

The es appears to bs widely spread in East lndia from Ceylon and the Penin-
sula toffilmayan Archi lngo and in Ε. tropioal Africa. lt rs easily reeegnised
by the closely denticulater of the racemes, vell indicated by Vahl but omitted
by Kunth in his transcription of Vahl's diagnosis. Α. traditiosam, R. Bm, has a
nearly similar rhaohis but much smaller flevere with some other differonoes The
flowcrs in A. giganteum are variable‚ largest in a few Indinn specimens, rather
arnallcr in the African and Australian ones, especially in the above-mentioned var.
racilie. In Wight's fi of A. aerisonum, the staminodia are represented with
bearded filamente aa pffithe perfect stamens. but that is evidently an orror cf the
artist, who has also m all the Amilemaa figimed the staminodia as alternating with
the perfect stamerm instead of each being collected on one side.
