17. ennom, Ait.
Spikelets 1·flowered, sessile or shortly pedicellate along the con·

tinuous rhachis ofa loose simple spihe or raceme. Glumes 3, 2 outer
empty ones linear, rigid, tapermg into long terminal straight awns, the
lowest the lon est. Termine] flowering glume much smaller, thin and
. hyaline, the paiea still smaller. Styles very shortly united at the base,
the plumeae stigmas short. Grain narrow‚ free, longer than the
terminal glume, enclosed in the 2 rigid outer ones.

The genus extends over tropieal and sub-tropical Asia and Africa„ the Australian

branching barb, slender‚ ascending tol lt. or rather more. Leaves
linear, with subulate points, glabrous except a lew marginal cilia
especially at the orilice of the sheaths; ligula ciliate. Spihe or
raceme in some specimens 3 to 4 in, in others at least twice as long.
Spihelets always numerous, at first erect 'at length reflexed, in some
specimens almost sessile, in others on pedicels of l to above ᾗ line long,
ol'ten ciliate with a few hairs; the spikelets very narrow‚2 to 3lines
long without the fine awns which are ᾖ to lin. long. Outer glume
with aprominent keel, sometimes glabrous, in a few specimens ciliate
with rather long bairs, and glume similar but rather shorter and
narrower.—-F. Muell. Fragm. viii. 115.

solitary, in alternate notches of the articulate rhachis of a simple spite,

This subtrrhe differs from the spicate Euandropogoneae in the total absence os any
