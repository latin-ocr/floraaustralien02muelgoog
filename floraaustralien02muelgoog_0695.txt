No true leaves. Planta consisting ot' a rhiaome or rooting or
twining stem or sim letrunl, omitting either alternate or a terminal
tult of more or lessheailike fronde. These consist ol a stalli or stapes,
frequentl bearing narrow brown glossy scales especially at the base
and on the rhizome, and a simple or variously divided or compound
lamina, usually more expanded and leaflihe when barren than when
fertile, the frond when young rolled inwards or circinata at the top
(except in Ophiogloaseae). Spore-cases usuall small, collected (rarely
united) in clusters or patches called aava¹ (rarely solitary) on the under
sur-face or margins of the fertile fronde which are either nearly
similar to the barren ones or very narrow resembling simple or
branched spihes. Sori either naked, or covered when young with a
membrana called indoctum (or sometimes involucre), variously

This beautiful Order is abundant in all moist elimatas hot or oold, less so in dry
and arid countries. The majority of the genera andaoonsiderable number of species
