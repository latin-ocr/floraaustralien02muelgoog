the nut, which is smooth or minutely granular, without the prominent
striae and furrows of S. selescar. It varies much in form, sometimes
globular or obovoid as in S. cethecus, sometimes obtusely but equally tri-

uetrons or more frequently in Australian specimens witha broad rnnar
lace, the back very conver or obtusely angled but these forms pass so
gradually one into another as to maleit very difficolt to sort the speci·
mens into distinct varieties. The nut is always shorter and never so
