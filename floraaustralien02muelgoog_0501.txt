F. Mueller (fragm. viii. 191) refers the whole species to the North American P.
capellare, Gronov, to which it certainly bears some general resemblance, but 11111
speeies has as far ae is known always 1 male flower in the 3rd lame, which Ι have
never found iu the Australian P. offanum, besides other minor ' arenoes.

51. Ρ. Miteaeui, Boseth—An 11111 grass, decumbant at the base

only, 2 to 3 ft. high, nearly allied 1ο P. fferam, but larger‚ quite glab-
rous and the nodes not bearded. Leaves often long, the short ligula
rather jagged than ciliate. Paniole usually very large and spreadin
with very numerous divided filiform branchos, the lower ones clustered
and rigid‚ the upper ones scattered. dpilrelets all pedicellate‚ usually
several along the ultimate branchos, rather above l line long, acutely
acuminato, quite glabrous. Outor glume acute, nearly ᾗ the length of
the epikelet‚ l· to 3·nerved; and and 3rd glumee nearly equal,
acutely acuminate, about 5·nerved, a palea in the 3rd sometimes very
sgrall, more frequently above ὲ the glume. F ruiting glume smooth and
srnrng.

A smallor glaucone plant with a smaller panicle and rather larger spikelets, frum
Cooper's Greek, Howitt's Expedition, appears to be a variety of this species.

1⁸¹, Mueller, Fragm. x. te, mentions P. irrmmptum, Trin, as haring been guthered by
Dallaoh at Rockingham Bay. 1 have not found among Dallachy'e plante in Herb.

P. M 11111ιί11, which are allied to it but according to my viewe quite distinct.
