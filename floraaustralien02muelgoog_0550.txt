er 3 to 8 or 10 tt. high, the nedes glabrous. Leaves long aud flat,
often rather broad, the midrib usually white and prominent. Panicle
from bordin. to above 1 ft. long, loose and often ronch branehed.
Fertile spikelets lanceolata, varying from 2 to above 3 lines long, pale
coloured or scarcely purple, not rutbns, with a few heire at the base.
Outer coriaeeous glunic laintly many-nerved, at length smooth aud
shiuiug, and glume rather smaller, 5·uerved‚ usually sprinkled with a
