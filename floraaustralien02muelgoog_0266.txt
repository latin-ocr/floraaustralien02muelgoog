enuease oi known speeies sinee their time. N ees v. Esenbeelr created some οοιιοιοίοιι
ογ splitting up the genera upon minor charam which have proved still lese oen·
etant, and that confusion has been very much encreased b Soudel's mest unarum·
tery compilation. Buecheler, in the laet velantes oi the linnae hes sinae rendered

service ογ his elaborate enumeration ei the preraeeae oi the Berhn herbanum,
ut, ss to the Australian species, he has generally had but ' le speeimens olim
very imperfect to work upon, end appears to me to have estab ' od several upon
very insufficentgreunds. His long so·ealled diagnosee or rather ablativa desmip·
tiens are useful as showing the variations species are eubjeated to, eut, net being
centrastsd, 'vo but little assistance in the practieal determination oi speeies.
Another diffigdul Iheve had to contend with proceeds hom the wide range ela
large rtion ei eAustralian speeies, and in many cases it would require a more
careialostudy ol identieal or representative species in ether countries than I have
been able te make, to ascertain whether these here adopted are really dishnet. The
order more than any other requires a carehrl revision on the part ei‘a competent
bounist, who could devote years to the taslr ol earefnlly scrutinising the prin·
capel British end Continental herbaria.

I am indebted tc Dr. Gareke, Direetor ci the Royal Herban'um at Berlin, ior the
leun oi all the Australian preraceae it wntains which euabled me to identiiy these
demribetl by Boeclreler; unfortunately‚ however, it does not comprise those collected
by Mrs. Amalia Dietrich in Queensland and described ογ Boeelrelerin the ‘Flora’
ier 1875, end Ihed overlooked this paper till aiter I had written out the order ier

rem and returned Baron Muellers collections. It seems very unlikely that Mra.

ietrich should have found 21 nov species in a part ei the country so theroughly
expilared ογ Beron Mueller'e numerous correspondents, and efter aa eareial a atudy
as could melre el Boeclreler's complicated diagneees‚ Ihave identified with mereor
less ei plausibility the greater number oi them. There are tvve vvhieh Ihad already
doecribed as new under other names ior which I have substitutsd Boeclreler’athe
others appear te me to be identical with or very slight varieties of published macres,
vvith the exception of a Solaria, about whiehI feel very uncertain.
