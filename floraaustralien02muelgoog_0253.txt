W. Australis. Various localities from King Georgs's Sound to Swan Ricar,
Drummowd, Praise, n. 1196, Oldsteld, Matr, Prior and others. Some of thalarger
specimens hare almost the aspect ol Lepyrods'c ylawca.

6. 1.. aristatas, R. Br. Prod. 250.-—Rhizome tested, scarcely
oreeping, glabrous or nearly so. Stems slender, creet, simple, about
lft. high, accomponied sometimes bya few short flexuose-branohed
barren stema. Sheathing scales closely a pressed, acute or with minute
points, under ὲ in. long. Male s rheldts closely resembling those of
Restio leptoeorpoides, 3 to 4 lines lbng, on fililorm clustered pedicels,
spreading or pendulous. Glumes slightly spreading, acutely acuminata, -
almost aristote. Perianth reduced to small thiu spathulate segments or
sometimes entirely deficient. Filaments short. Female spilrelets
narrow, ereot, about 4 lines long, sessile in 2 or 3 clusters at the end of
the stem with sometimes 1 112 clusters lower down, the floral bracts
short, broad, and brown. Glurucs very irregularly imbricata, often 2 or 3
flowers apparently in one glume with an empty glume immediately
below 11. Perianth·segments 6, 3 outer ones subulats, rigid with long
glabrous points or awns, densely but shortly ciliate at' the base, the
hairs not showing outside the closed spilrelet 11 they do in L. eriawthwu

7. 1.. erianthua, Barth—Vm closely allied to L. aristatas with
the same habit and inflorescence, but the rhizome usually woolly, the
stema not quite so slender and all simple in the specimens seen. Male
spilrelets spreading on pendulous or filiform clustered pedicels, narrow,
3 to 4 lines long. Glumes very broad, closely imbricato but acute or
with short slightly spreading points. Perianthsegments 5 or 6, 111111

thin and unequal. Filoments very short. Female spilrelets in dense
