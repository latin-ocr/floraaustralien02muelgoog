W. annualia? There is a specimen in the Hoolrerian herbarium marked
King George's Sound, 00112'0, but as there is no other specimen iu our herbaria from
that well-marched locality it is probable there is some mistalre.

The species, easily distingsushed amo all the large blech panicled ones, by the
number of short closely imbricata outer g umes,is r variable in the apex ol these

lumes more or less obtuse, in the length to whio tha fllameuts protrude aster
lesing their anthera, oud especially in the siae ol the nuts. In the larger typieal
Tasmanian form, ol which l have only seen a very lew N. S. Wales specimus, the
nut is about 2 lines long. In the majority ol the N. S. Wsles specimeus und a lew
of the southern ones the spikelets are smallor, the glumas rather less obtuse, the
sternens usually but not always less conspicuous sud the nuta very much roselles,
but there are many intermediate specimens. It isto these small red-fruited forms
that belongs the θ. erythraeam, R. Bal. o. 2³9, from Pbrt J aokson. G. suasam, R.
Br. 1. c. from Kiug's laland, Bsss’s Straim, is nearly the same but the fruita are pale·
coloured, perhaps notripe. I should also, from the descriptions, refer to the smallq,
fruited Port Jackson forms, the θ. Uroillsana, Kunth‚ Enum. ii. ³³2, and 0. yona·
