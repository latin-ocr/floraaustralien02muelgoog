Leaves few, short, and dying off early. Stcms rather slender but rigid,
ercet, about llt. high, simple and flexuosa in the lower half, dichoto-
mously paniculate in the upper part; soma oi the stems quite barren
with tha branchlets very numerous and short, the flowering stems tollor
with the branchlats longer and less numerous. Umbels and howars ol

the contrast of tha barren and flowaring stems give it a peculiar aspect.

Perianth twistad ovar the ovary alter flowering‚ but at length decidu-
ous, oi 6 segments very shortly connected at the base, all equal or the
inner ones rather smaller. Stamene 6, attached to tho base ol tha
perianth, 8 opposite the outer segmenta with vary short filamants‚ and a
small lanceolata anther with little orno pollam& opposite the inner
segmenta perfect, with rather longer filaments ; anthera linear, antire, as
long as the perianth, coharing round the style, tha connectives produced
beyond the narrow cells into a single tube. Ovary short, 3·celled‚ with2
ovulas (or sometimes only 1 l) in each call; styla fililorm, with a small
capitata terminal stigma. Capsule broad, hfurrowed, the pericarp rather
thick, opening loculioidally in 3 valvas. Seeds usuallyl in each call,
not flattenad‚ with a black shining crustaceous testa. Albumen copious,
