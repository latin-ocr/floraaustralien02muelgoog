very narrow to rather broad· Paniele usually long and sleuder‚ the
brauehes or sessile spikes or elusters ereet‚ distant, the lower ones 3 to
4 lines or rar-ely ὲ to 1 in. long, the upper ones smaller, often reduced
to short clusters or ιο single spikelets towards the end ol' the panicle,
the rhnchis of the branches often but not alirays produced beyond the
last spikelet into a point sorpetimes as long ns the spihelet. Spikelets
singly sessile or in pairs, one pedieellate the other sessile along the
rhaehis, rarely more or less distinetly iu 2 rows almost as in P. flovi-
dum, ovoid, 1 to 11 lines long, nearly straight, the outer glume ovate
acute rather less or more thau half ns long as the spikelet, the second
aud third nearly equal, both em ty membraneus and about 5·nerved,
l'ruiting glunie as long or ratherionger, minutely transvereely rugose.
