or scales. Stamene 1 to 8. Style alender, deciduum, with afiliform
stigmatio branehes. Nut globular or avoid, usually white, raised on a

The genus is generally spread over the tropieal and subtrepioal ωςίοιιι of the
New andthe Old world, extending also into the temperate regiona ol North
Ameriae. Of tha thirteen Austrahan speeies five are widely spread over tropienl
Asia, two or three ol themelae in Africa, two are atleast inthe Malayan Arehipehgo
or in tha Paeiflo lalanda, the remaining six appear to be eudemio. Nospeoaes has
been found in New Zealand. The habit of the genua is ve variable, but not more
so than that of alma, and nlthou h ithae been divided y Nees and others into
about a doaen genera, chiefly found on the formos thedislr, Ihave been unable to
discover an distinet sectional οδω-ποίου beyond those whieh repente n'ngle speeies.
and tha lo owing series are founded chiefly on infloresoanee.
