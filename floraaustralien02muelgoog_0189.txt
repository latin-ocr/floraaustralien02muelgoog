The species is one oi the most common orer tho greater part ol the area oi the
genua The few specimens in which the flocting leaves are wanting are sometimes

confounded with varieties of P. obtusisolius, but are readily distinguished by the
leaves more or less potiolste and several-nerved.

denticulato.

This is evidenti thesemo as the Bengal plant which Indian botanim have ro·
ferred to the No American P. hybridae, hiiah. which it closely resembles in habit,
foliage, and inflorescence, but the fruit is very different and the seed is not spirally
coiled. It maybe, as suggested by F. Mueller, thesemo as P. juvenca, Hasslr. from
J arn, audii so, should bear that namo, but the character given is insufficient lor veri·

This differs from most old-world species and eomes nearest to the N. American
P. hybridas in its small nutlets and coiled seeds. but differs from that species in the
subm ed leaves remarkably large and ulra-like, the flooring leaves mach thinner
and nilion longer and the seed not quite so spiral.
