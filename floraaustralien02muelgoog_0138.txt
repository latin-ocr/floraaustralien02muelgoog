Perianth persistent, of 6 equal erect long snd narrow distinct seg·
ments. Stamene 6, attached to the base of the segmente and shorter
’ than them; filaments rigid, slightly flattened; anthera long snd linear,
ercet, very shortly 2-lobcd at the base, the cells opening inwards in
longitndinsl slits. Ovary sessile, 3·celled, with l erect ovule in esch
cell; style subulate, rigid, with a small terminal stigma. Cspsule
oboroid, flat-topped, opening elsstically in 6 volves, leaving the dissepi-
