times 2 on a pedicel, the pedieel or axis produced into a point shorter
than the spilielet. Ouier empty glumes 2, several-nerved; flowering
glumes 2, nearly equal, longer than the empty ones, each with a palea ·
and 3 stamens. Female plant: Heuds the siae ol the males when in
honen, but the bracts largsr and brosder, and when in fruit the bracts
variously enlnrged, l or2 often becoming curved, l in. lon or more,
broad with hard centres ond scarious margins, sometimes all scarcely
changed. Spilrelets almost sessile within each braot, the very short
pedicel produced into a point much shorter than the spilrelet, and some·
times minute or obsoleto. Empty glumes promiuontly 7- or9·11erved,
the 2 outer rather shorter than tbe 3rd, which is either empty lilio
