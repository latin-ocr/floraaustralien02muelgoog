tufted rather tall or dwarf plaute, the stem inflorescence aud sometimes
the leaves more or less clothed or sprinlrled with loose almost woolly
hairs. Leaves chiefly radical, long and veryprominently nerved. Stems

paniole, shortly pedicellate along its branchos, or rarely few iu a short
corymb each within a single bract, aud usually hermaphrodite.

The genus is limited to Tasmania. With something ei the habit oi Aetolia, the
